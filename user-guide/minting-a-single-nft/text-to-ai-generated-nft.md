# ðŸ¤– Text to AI Generated NFT

Genadrop's AI art platform blurs the line between life and art. With its text-to-art capabilities, anyone can generate images and mint them on the blockchain using just a keyboard. Simply type in your idea into the search bar, and voila! You have an AI-generated piece of art. Although Genadrop's AI is free to use, there is a small catch. After each art generation, you will be required to watch a short ads.

Firstly, type your idea or description into the Text Field.

Hit the "Create" button to start the AI image generation process.

Wait for the AI to process your text and create the image. This may take a few seconds to a minute, depending on the complexity of your idea.

Preview the generated image and click recreate incase you're not okay with the first output.

Once you are satisfied with the image, click the "Mint" or "Download" button to save or mint the image to the blockchain, respectively.

Before you can save or mint the image, you may be required to watch a short video ad.

After the ad, the image will be uploaded.

Next, name the art, add a description, select the category, and add attributes **(what are attributes?)**.

Either click the toggle button and enter a different address to mint to the recipient's wallet directly or mint directly to your wallet.
