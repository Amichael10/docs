## What is A Generative Collection

A generative collection is one where the program generates layers and different rarities to create thousands of images. Ex; Bored Apes

## What You Need Before Hand

* You need all layers of your art in the same size as transparent pngs
* It helps to organize into folders of different layers with each layer named on the PNG file with the name you want it to show up on the NFT metadata
