## About the Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

## Genadrop's Graph Implementation

Currently on GenaDrop the subgraph supports every supported chain except Algorand.&#x20;

This includes

* Avalanche, Algorand, Aurora, Celo, Arbitrum, Polygon, and NEAR (NEAR is only non-evm chain supported by the Graph)
