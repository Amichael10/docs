👛 How to Connect Wallet
========================

The most confusing thing about GenaDrop being a multi-chain tool?

  

The following is a tutorial on the wallet flow:

  

In order to **buy** and **mint** NFTs, you must connect your wallet for the respective blockchain.

  

For more details on how to set up each wallet for each blockchain, go here: How to Connect Wallet ([https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887](https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887))

  

How to Mint
-----------

You first either have the option to mint -

*   the .ZIP collection folder you downloaded from the GenaDrop CREATE section **OR**
*   a 1 of 1 (unique) art piece (.PNG) / Take a photograph with your phone or webcam

  

**Minting on Algorand**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZaAsZYdDAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZaAsZYdDAg)

  

### Collections

With the collections mint, all the appropriate metadata for each NFT, collection, etc. was created when u zipped up the collection in the "Create section". In the listing section.

  

User Flow

1.  Click to upload .ZIP collection

a. Click "Browse files" or drag and drop your files.

  

2\. Edit information (if need be)

  

3\. Connect wallet

a. Click connect wallet

  

4\. Choose chain

a. Ex: Algorand

b. Insert price for NFT

  

5\. Mint

a. Click Mint.

  

Here is how to mint an NFT (in this case on Algorand)

[https://youtu.be/6Ku0vccZCPM](https://youtu.be/6Ku0vccZCPM)

  

  

Unlike the price for 1 of 1s, the collection price is the mint price (or the initial floor price).

1 of 1s
-------

For 1 of 1s, you can simply select 1 of 1 option on the Mint page and then upload your picture. Here is the following information you need for an NFT.

  

*   Name (Title)
*   Description
*   Attributes: Values
*   Blockchain to Mint On
*   Mint Price

  

When you click mint the wallet flow will popup where you will be prompted to connect your wallet (or to create on) to the blockchain you are minting on. (You will have to pay gas for the respective blockchain you are minting on. For more information on the wallet, flow sees: How to Connect Wallet ([https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887](https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887)) .

  

Note: Minted NFTs may not appear immediately on your dashboard. Please reload the page if you do not see them, or go to the marketplace.

Minting 1 of 1s using a camera
------------------------------

Now with photography built into our app, u can use your camera to take photos or videos (convert the video from MP4 to GIF and mint, or leave it as default MP4 and can also mint to any of our supported blockchains)

  

Here are simple steps for minting to any supported blockchains using the camera feature

  

*   Connect a supported wallet **see** How to Connect Wallet ([https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887](https://share-docs.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-2087/29cf6dd595624ca/4e6q4-1887))
*   Go to Genadrop mint Page and select 1 of 1 Minting option
*   Click on the open camera button inside the 1 of 1 mint
*   Grant permission to enable the camera feature to work on your device
*   Take a photo or hold the button to make a video instead (click continue when satisfied with the shot to proceed to minting)
*   Input Title, description, and Attributes
*   Select blockchain and click mint

  

Here is a tutorial video on how to mint NFT to different blockchains using the camera feature

# FAQ

### _Where do I find documentation on GenaDrop_

[genadrop.com/docs](http://genadrop.com/docs)

### **_What is a generative collection?_**

A generative collection is a group of NFTs that use a computer program for the rendering of their art. This is commonly done with profile pictures that choose different traits for the same layer at different rarities that the computer then layers and outputs a unique image. Generative collections have also been used to reference AI-generated art.

**_What does GenaDrop mean when it says it's "multi-chain"?_**

GenaDrop allows users to mint NFTs (or publish them to the public)  to a number of different blockchains, or decentralized databases. This means you get to choose which blockchain you want to publish your work on. We at the Minority Programmers have a chain-agnostic approach to building Web3 dApps and will continue to add different chains onto the platform at the request of members of the Minority Programmers DAO. 

  

**_How does GenaDrop store my images?_**

GenaDrop uses a form of decentralized storage called IPFS to mint your NFTs.

  

**_What if I want to mint on Solana?_**

Currently, GenaDrop “Create” pages format metadata for both IPFS & Arweave. Arweave is the go-to decentralized storage solution for Solana NFT projects. This makes it easy to mint a service like Metaplex’s Candy Machine. Direct integration into Solana with a marketplace is yet to be implemented and can be prioritized by creating a proposal in the Minority Programmers DAO?

  

**How do I start using Genadrop?**

When you’re making a generative NFT collection, each final image will be made out of different traits that can be mixed and matched. First of all you must have basic assets for layer combination generation. [Example: the main background layer, body, and few traits. For more informat](about:blank)ion watch this demo [https://youtu.be/wC0odzMW\_9g](https://youtu.be/wC0odzMW_9g)

[https://youtu.be/wC0odzMW\_9g](https://youtu.be/wC0odzMW_9g)

  

  

**What are the requirements for the assets**

Each layer in the image represents a trait (Hair, Outfit, etc), and each trait will have many variants (Short Purple Hair, Long Purple Hair, etc). Draw each variant on a transparent. PNG file so all the layers will be visible. Each image should be the same size, You can add conflict rules to selected layers. Preview and download your collection.

  

**How do I mint my collection?**

Connect your wallet and upload your collection zip folder, previously made in the create section of the Genadrop dApp. as a JSON file after which you will now upload your Metadata to ipfs and select the blockchain of your choice, add price, and Mint.

  

**Which blockchains does Genadrop support?**

*   Algorand
*   Polygon 
*   Celo
*   Avalenche (Coming Soon)
*   Near (Coming Soon)
*   Aurora EVM

  

**_Can I resell my art after it's been minted on Genadrop_**

Yes, NFTs can be transferred and resold that have been minted on the respective public blockchains.

  

**How many editions of an NFT can create**

You can select how many NFTs (must be less than possible combinations that can be produced. The more editions the longer it will take for your art to generate and upload. 

**_What are some features of GenaDrop art generation tool?_**

With the Genadrop art creation tool ([genadrop.com/create](http://genadrop.com/create)) an artist can upload and name different assets, choose blanks images, edit rarities, reorder layers, see possible combinations, choose generation size, omit or replace from combination with new images, rename collection and metadata for both EVM and Solana blockchains. 

Also, there's a generate GIF feature that allows for creating any number of GIFs from generated arts.

**Note:** GIF generation time is dependent on the number of art selected.

  

**_Does GenaDrop save my assets_**

To avoid our users loosing progress during create sessions, we auto-save creation progress including assets, conflict rules, rarity settings, and layer order for users who subscribed to any of our paid plans.

  

  

**_What type of NFT(s) can I mint?_**

Genadrop supports Minting a photo with your device camera, minting 1 of 1 images and collections.

To mint a photo, go to Mint page select 1 of 1s and click open camera, take a shot, enter metadata, choose blockchain, and click mint.

To mint 1 of 1 NFT select your NFT file\[supported file format: png\] , enter metadata, and click mint.

To mint a collection, Upload zip downloaded from create app, choose blockchain, and click mint.

  

**Where do I learn about all the terms used in the GenaDrop app?**
