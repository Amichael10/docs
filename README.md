## About GenaDrop

Coming from the name "**Generative** **Drops**". GenaDrop allows artists to create layers, choose rarities, add conflict rules, add blank images, pick the number to generate, generate a preview, delete bad images, edit metadata, download a zip, upload to your preferred storage(among the category of our supported storage), mint to multiple blockchains with a simple to use user interface.
